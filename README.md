Open-Source Full-Stack Solution For React/Redux Isomorphic Applications

## Before You Begin

Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a CodingBox.IO application:

* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* ReactJS - ReactJS's [Official Website](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Pete Hunt's Guide](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Redux - Go through [Official Documentation](http://redux.js.org/). Also, [Egghead Videos by Dan Abramov, creator of Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) are really awesome to begin with.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.
